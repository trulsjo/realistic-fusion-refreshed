.SYNOPSIS
    Checks a commit message against the format CLAUDE.md lays down: gitmoji, Conventional Commits,
    a subject of 72 characters or fewer, and a body wrapped at 72.

.DESCRIPTION
    A GATE, and the only one here that reads a commit message. It starts no game and touches no
    prototype, so it belongs with ship-check.ps1 and locale-check.ps1 rather than with the checks
    that build a map -- and like ship-check it exists because the thing it reads is prose that
    every other gate is blind to.

    WHY IT EXISTS. CLAUDE.md has said "Wrap at 72" since the repository started, and nothing was
    reading it. Measured by this script against the last fifty commits on main, 2026-09-06:
    21 of the 50 are rejected, on 183 body lines over 72 and 5 subject lines over 72 -- the
    longest subject being 82 characters. The argument reached for at review time was that a rule
    main breaks this widely must not really apply. That is backwards: a rule nothing enforces is a
    rule that rots, and the fix is the enforcement rather than the excuse.

    A FIRST COUNT OF THIS SAID 201 LINES IN EVERY ONE OF THE FIFTY, and it was wrong in the
    direction that flatters the finding. It was an awk one-liner over `git log`, and it charged
    every `Co-Authored-By:` and every session URL to the rule -- lines this script exempts on
    purpose and git would corrupt if they wrapped. The real number is smaller and it is still 21
    commits in 50. Stated because a gate whose own justification is unmeasured is the thing it
    exists to prevent.

    WHAT IT CHECKS, and every rule here is quoted from CLAUDE.md's "Commit messages" section:

      subject   <emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>, with the RENDERED emoji rather than a
                :shortcode:. Imperative mood is not checkable and is not checked.
      pairing   The ten types each have one emoji, and the emoji has to be the type's own. This is
                the rule that catches a real one in history: bf44099 is `docs fix(repo)`.
      case      Lowercase after the colon. Held perfectly in 300 commits, so it is safe to enforce.
      stop      No trailing period.
      length    The whole subject line, 72 characters or fewer.
      breaking  A `!` before the colon requires a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. All seven breaking
                commits in history carry one, so this too is safe to enforce.
      blank     A blank line between the subject and the body.
      wrap      Every body line, 72 characters or fewer.

    WHAT IT DELIBERATELY LETS THROUGH:

      - TRAILERS. `Co-Authored-By:` and `Claude-Session:` end in a URL or an address that cannot be
        broken, and git parses that block by position. Wrapping them would corrupt them.
      - A LINE WHOSE LONGEST WORD IS ITSELF OVER THE LIMIT. No wrapping makes such a line fit, so
        flagging it would only teach people to ignore the gate. A bare long URL in a body is the
        real case.
      - fixup!, squash! and amend! subjects, which git rewrites away on rebase.
      - Auto-generated `Merge ...` and `Revert "..."` subjects, which git writes rather than a
        person. The repository's OWN merges are written by hand as `🔀 chore(repo): merge ...` and
        are checked like anything else.

    ON 🔀. CLAUDE.md's table does not list it and this script accepts it, because the repository has
    used it for merge commits eight times and a gate that failed those would be asserting a rule
    nobody agreed to. It is accepted the way the other situational emoji are -- with any type --
    rather than given a row of its own. If that is wrong, the fix is one line in $SITUATIONAL and a
    row in CLAUDE.md, and it should be CLAUDE.md first.

.PARAMETER Path
    The file holding the message to check. This is what git passes a `commit-msg` hook. Comment
    lines and everything below a scissors line are stripped first, the same as git does.

.PARAMETER Range
    Check the messages of every commit in a revision range instead of a file, e.g. `-Range
    origin/main..HEAD` before opening a pull request, or `-Range '-50 main'` to sweep recent
    history. Split on spaces and passed to `git rev-list`, so anything that takes is a range.
    Reports every commit that fails and exits non-zero if any did.

.PARAMETER SelfTest
    Prove the checker can FAIL. A gate that only ever passes is a gate that has stopped reading, so
    this runs a table of messages that must each be rejected for a named reason, and a table that
    must be accepted. It starts nothing and takes about a second.
