.SYNOPSIS
    Fails if the two things a player must be told before installing have stopped being said.

.DESCRIPTION
    ADR 0003 and ADR 0006 each create an obligation that is a sentence rather than code: the clean
    break from predecessor saves must be "stated plainly wherever players will look", and the quality
    interaction must be "a named known-gap, not a silent one". Issue #35 discharged both. Nothing else
    in this repository would notice if they were edited away, because neither is a prototype, a name
    or a number -- load-check, locale-check and name-check all pass on a mod that says nothing at all.

    So this check is deliberately about prose and files, and it needs no Factorio. It asserts:

      - LICENSE, LICENSE.GPL and legal-note.txt ship inside each mod, not only at the repo root, and
        each mod's legal-note.txt still ends with the root one verbatim, behind a preamble saying
        where it came from. Three copies of a file is three chances to drift; this is what makes
        the copies safe.
      - Each mod's info.json description and its English [mod-description] agree. They are duplicated
        because Factorio reads one before the locale loads and the other after, and a player sees
        whichever the moment supplies -- so the two saying different things is the failure that would
        never be noticed.
      - Both descriptions, and README.md, carry the clean break and the quality gap.
      - Romner_set, Durikkan and PreLeyZero are credited. No licence asks for it (see CLAUDE.md); it
        is a community norm, which is exactly the kind of thing that quietly disappears in an edit.

    WHAT IT CANNOT CHECK

    That the sentences are true, or that a player reads them. It matches on the load-bearing words --
    the predecessors by name, "not supported", "quality" -- so a rewrite that keeps the meaning passes
    and a deletion does not. A rewrite that keeps the words and loses the meaning also passes, and
    there is no version of this check that would not.

    Nor does it look at the mod portal, where the long description lives outside the zip. That copy is
    uploaded by hand and this repository cannot see it.

    There is no -SelfTest here, unlike the checks that read a Factorio dump. Those need one because
    they can pass by finding nothing; this one names every file and string it requires, so a mistake
    in it fails rather than goes quiet.
