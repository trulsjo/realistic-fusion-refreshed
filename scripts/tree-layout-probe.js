/*
  Measures dagre layout alternatives against a rendered tech-tree viewer. The instrument behind
  docs/research/tree-layout-levers.md and the #182 rank-split sweep in it.

  A PROBE, NOT A CHECK. It asserts nothing: it lays the same graph out several ways and prints what
  each one costs. Which way is better is a judgement, and the answer has already differed by lane.

  HOW TO RUN IT

    1. Render a lane:  pwsh -File scripts/tree-viewer.ps1 -AlsoModDirectory .mod-cache/angels `
                            -OutName angels-lane
    2. Open tree-viewer-out/angels-lane.html in Chrome and WAIT for the cards to appear. The probe
       reads its node sizes off the rendered cards, so there have to be cards.
    3. Paste this whole file into the console.
    4. RIG.start('TB')  — or 'LR'. It yields between layouts; poll RIG.stage and RIG.rows.
    5. RIG.table()      — a markdown table of everything measured so far.

  Rows accumulate across sweeps, so a TB run and an LR run land in one table; RIG.clear() starts
  over. A third argument narrows the split to ranks holding more than n cards:
  RIG.start('TB', ['graph/floor', 'graph/ceil'], 12).

  WHY IT READS THE DOM FOR NODE SIZES

  The viewer computes each card's height from its unlock count and a measured head, and the levers
  note records three separate occasions where a MODEL of the card disagreed with the card. So this
  does not re-derive the formula: it reads offsetWidth/offsetHeight off the cards the viewer drew.
  A probe that cannot drift from the render is worth more than one that is merely shorter.

  WHAT A ROW MEANS

  Edge length is the summed segment length of the polyline dagre returns -- what the eye follows.
  Scaffolding edges (below) are marked and are never counted, never drawn, and never reported.

  THE RANK SPLIT (#182)

  "Use more ranks so each holds fewer cards" cannot be asked of dagre directly; minlen only scales
  the same ranks apart. It needs scaffolding edges between cards that currently SHARE a rank, which
  means laying out twice -- once to learn the ranks, once with the scaffolding in. Within a rank of
  n cards, ordered by `order`, the split takes the first k as the upper half and the rest as the
  lower, and joins them pairwise; `half` is where k falls on an odd n. That tie-break is not
  cosmetic -- see the note.

    order  graph  the order the viewer added the nodes
           x      by cross-rank coordinate in the first layout, ascending
           xrev   the same, descending
    half   floor  k = floor(n/2)
           ceil   k = ceil(n/2)
           alt    no block split at all: even indices up, odd indices down

  /* dagre gives every node in a rank the same coordinate along the rank axis -- positionY assigns
     one y per layer -- so grouping by it recovers the layering exactly, with no access to dagre's
     internals. Dummy nodes never appear: layout() writes back only to the graph it was given.

     Upper-cased on the way in because dagre is not: it lower-cases rankdir internally and lays out
     correctly either way, so a 'tb' passed in here would lay out top-down and then be MEASURED
     across the wrong axis -- ranks recovered from the cross coordinate, scaffolding joining cards
