.SYNOPSIS
    Fill a cache directory with third-party mods at pinned versions, for load-check -AlsoModDirectory.

.DESCRIPTION
    The one step that was missing (#60). `load-check.ps1 -AlsoModDirectory` already junctions whatever
    mod directories it finds, and `Write-ModList` already enables any name it is handed without
    validating it, so nothing downstream needed changing. What did not exist was a way to GET a
    third-party mod onto disk at a version somebody chose.

    GIT FIRST, PORTAL AS THE FALLBACK -- Truls's call, 2026-08-26 (#60). The ticket set out three
    shapes and declined to choose between them. Git-only is cheapest but cannot reach a mod that
    publishes nowhere else; portal-only reaches everything but makes every coexistence check
    unrunnable on a machine that has never signed in to Factorio. This does both, and the cost is
    honestly two mechanisms to keep working rather than one.

    Consequence worth stating: a mod with a Git entry NEVER touches the portal, so it never reads
    player-data.json and never builds a URL with a token in it. The whole Krastorio 2 set is in that
    category, which is why the credential path below can be exercised deliberately (-PreferPortal)
    rather than only by accident.

    WHY A TAG IS A BETTER PIN THAN A VERSION STRING. `git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.0.19` names an
    immutable object and git verifies its own integrity on the way in, so there is no sha1 step to
    write and no "latest" to drift. The portal half has no such property, which is why it does have
    one: every release carries a `sha1` and it is checked before the zip is used, cached or fresh.

    WHAT THE PIN DOES NOT GUARANTEE, and it is worth knowing before trusting this for a coexistence
    claim: a git tag is the mod's SOURCE, and the portal zip is the mod's RELEASE. They are usually
    the same tree and are not required to be. Every mod fetched here therefore has its info.json
    version checked against the pin afterwards -- that catches a mistagged release, though not a
    release built from a tree that was never tagged.

    THE TOKEN IS THE DANGEROUS PART. The portal's download endpoint takes credentials as QUERY
    PARAMETERS, so the URL itself is a secret. Four things follow, and all four are enforced rather
    than hoped for: the URL is never written to output; `Invoke-WebRequest` is called with
    -Verbose:$false so a caller's -Verbose cannot print it; every error that escapes the download is
    scrubbed before it is rethrown; and the ErrorRecord PowerShell files in $Error is DROPPED, because
    a scrubbed message is not the only copy -- the record's TargetObject holds the request URI, token
    and all, even when the message does not. `-SelfTest` proves all of it with a sentinel rather than
    asserting it, and checks 2/5 and 5/5 are two different checks for that reason: a child process
    takes its $Error to the grave, so only an in-process call can see that leak.

.PARAMETER Set
    Which pinned set to fetch. Eight are one per overhaul family, because declared incompatibilities
    make a single combined list impossible: krastorio2, angels, bobs, madclowns, spaceex, seablock,
    riteg, fluid. Pinned to each family's last factorio_version 2.0 release per ADR 0026 -- see the
    manifest.

    Three more are UNIONS of those families, for the lanes #61 asks for that no single family covers:
    k2-spaceex, angels-bobs and angels-bobs-madclowns. They are composed from the family pins rather
    than written out again, so refreshing a family refreshes every lane it appears in. Which
    combinations are possible at all is a matter of declaration, not taste -- SE declares
    `! space-age` and `!` against fourteen Angel's and Bob's mods, SeaBlockWanne declares
    `! space-age` and `! Krastorio2`, and Krastorio2 declares `! Clowns-Nuclear`,
    `! bobequipment` and `! bobvehicleequipment`. Those combinations have no set here and are not
    meant to get one.

.PARAMETER CacheDirectory
    Where the mods live between runs. Defaults to `.mod-cache/<set>/` beside the repository root,
    which is git-ignored. Deliberately NOT the temp mod directory a check builds: that is torn down
    per run, and refetching per run would be slow and rude. Measured, the Krastorio 2 set is
    414 MB -- 376 of it Krastorio2Assets, which is the mod that actually motivates caching;
    Krastorio2 itself is 28. Nearly half of that total is .git: --depth 1 keeps the history shallow,
    not absent, and an asset repository's single commit is still every sprite.

    PER SET, AND NOT BY PREFERENCE. One shared directory accumulates every set ever fetched, and
    load-check junctions everything it finds -- so fetching seablock after krastorio2 produced a
    51-mod directory containing both, which is not a set anybody chose and which SeaBlockWanne
    forbids outright (`! Krastorio2`). The same shape bites on versions: `flib` is pinned 0.16.2 for
    krastorio2 and 0.16.5 for seablock, and a cache keyed by name alone can only hold one of them.
    Separate directories cost duplicated downloads where lanes overlap and remove both problems.
    Pass this explicitly only if you want that behaviour back.

.PARAMETER PreferPortal
    Take the portal route even for a mod that has a Git source. Nothing needs this to work; it exists
    so the credential path can be exercised on a mod whose git route is known good, instead of only
    ever running when some other mod happens to lack a repository.

.PARAMETER Force
    Re-fetch even when the cache already holds the pinned version.

.PARAMETER PlayerDataPath
    Where to read the mod-portal credentials. Defaults to %APPDATA%\Factorio\player-data.json. A
    parameter rather than a constant so -SelfTest can point it at a file it controls.

.PARAMETER PortalBaseUrl
    The mod portal's base URL. A parameter for the same reason: it lets -SelfTest exercise the
    download path against an address that refuses instantly, so the leak check needs no network and
    no real credentials.

.PARAMETER SelfTest
    Prove this script does what it claims: that a union pinning one mod at two versions is refused
    rather than silently resolved, that a missing credential is reported as such, that the token
    reaches no output, and that a corrupted cached zip is rejected rather than used.

# The pins.
#
# THESE ARE VERSION DECISIONS, NOT MACHINERY, and #60 said so in as many words: "build the pin as a
# parameter and the answer fills it in later". #59 filled it in (ADR 0026): every family is pinned
# to its last factorio_version 2.0 release, because 2.1 is still the experimental branch and this
# repo still declares 2.0. Editing a number here is meant to be the whole job.
#
# DERIVED, NOT TRANSCRIBED. Each closure was computed from the portal API at the last fv 2.0
# release of every member, following no-prefix and `~` dependencies and ignoring `?`, `(?)`, `!`
# and `+`. Refreshing these means re-deriving them, which is also what happens when ADR 0008's
# trigger fires and the whole manifest re-points at the 2.1 releases.
#
# A PASSING LANE PROVES COEXISTENCE WITH THAT FAMILY'S 2.0 LINE AND NOTHING ELSE. ADR 0026 forbids
# an unqualified "works with Angel's" reaching a listing or a README on the strength of one.
#
# The Krastorio 2 set is FIVE mods and not the four #60's acceptance criteria list. At 2.0.19 --
# the last factorio_version 2.0 release, and the only K2 that loads beside this repo on 2.0.77 --
# Krastorio2's info.json declares `ChangeInserterDropLane >= 1.1.0` with NO PREFIX, which in
# Factorio's dependency syntax is a hard requirement (`?` optional, `(?)` hidden optional, `!`
# incompatible, `~` required but not load-order-affecting, bare = required). Fetching four would
# fail at load on a missing dependency. docs/research/mod-set-coexistence-targets.md records the
# same five, loaded rather than merely computed, and notes it is untrue of the 2.1 line.
#
# Tag defaults to 'v' + Version, which is what all five publish. Give an explicit Tag when it isn't.

    #
    # CORRECTED 2026-08-26: this comment used to say SeaBlockWanne declares SeaBlockPack with `+`.
    # It does not, at the version pinned here. SeaBlockWanne 1.0.5 names no SeaBlockPack at all --
    # its hard requirements are the four Angel's content mods and nothing else, a closure of nine.
    # The `+ SeaBlockPack` line appears first in 1.1.4, which is factorio_version 2.1 and therefore
    # a release this project does not target. At 2.0 the dependency runs the other way: SeaBlockPack
    # requires SeaBlockWanne.
    #
    # So the pack is pinned as a DELIBERATE CHOICE and not because a dependency asks for it: the
    # lane is worth more answering "does our mod load beside what a SeaBlock player installs" than
    # "beside the nine mods that strictly must load". The choice stands; the reason it was first
    # given was a 2.1 fact read onto a 2.0 pin.
    #
    # TWO THINGS THIS LANE NEEDS THAT NO OTHER DOES. It requires `quality`, which ships with
    # the game rather than the portal, so run load-check with -With quality; quality does not
    # pull in space-age, which matters because SeaBlockWanne declares `! space-age`. And it
    # overlaps the angels and bobs lanes -- twenty of their mods are hard requirements here,
    # so the three sets are not independent samples.
